# tpm_moveit
Note: currently, the only supported robot type is `AR3`. 

## Prerequisite
1. This guide assumes you are familiar with Moveit! platform and its concept about `move_group` and `FollowJointTrajectory`.  
   Also, make sure you have already setup the Moveit! environment. If not, check the [Moveit tutorial][moveit].
   
3. This guide assume you have successfully run the [basic_demo] of this repository.

## Available launch files
There are several launch files in the `tpm_moveit` project.
- **demo.launch.py:**  
  This will run `tpm_core_node`, `sample_ui`,  `move_group`, and `robot_state_publisher`
  
- **demo_with_rviz.launch.py:**  
  Similar to **demo.launch.py**, but with an additional `rviz (with MoveIt plugin)`.  
  Note: `rviz` might be laggy on RaspberryPi.
  
- **other launch files:**  
  These are automatically generated by MoveIt setup wizard.

You can set some parameters with launch file
- **use_sim** : Whether to run in simulation mode.  
  `true`: run in simulation mode.
  `false (default)` : run in real mode. This requires a **RPX-L132D1-ROS2** hardware and Drivers 

## Method 1: Run with Rviz
Use following command:  
```
ros2 launch moveit_ar3 demo_with_rviz.launch.py use_sim:=true
```
Where
``` 
    <package name>:  moveit_ar3   
    <launch file>:   demo_with_rviz.launch.py   
    <use_sim>:       true  
```    
than you can manipulate the `rivz` GUI, which will generate the `FollowJointTrajectory` that controls the robot.

## Run Demo (Method 2)
Alternatively, instead of using rviz, you can write your own code to generate FollowJointTrajectory.  
This [sample code](moveit_ar3/sample_client/moveit_loop.cpp) reads points from a file called `myPoints.txt`, and repeatedly send these points to move_group in order to generate FollowJointTrajectory.  
Run this sample using following command:  
  ```
  ros2 launch moveit_ar3 demo.launch.py use_sim:=true
  ros2 run moveit_ar3 moveit_loop
  ```
and make sure the `myPoints.txt` is in the same location where you run this command.
