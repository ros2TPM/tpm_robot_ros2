This folder contains files for Rviz to simulate 3D modules of robots.
- mesh: CAD files for robots.
- urdf: files specifying the geometry and organization of robots.
- rviz: config files for Rviz.

Rviz would be launched automatically while using the three default node configurations by following the instructions in [tpm_core_node](../tpm_core_node/README.md#tpm_core_node).
